# Base Odoo

This is the basic template for running oddo. The main idea is to start
every Odoo project as a fork of this repo.
For now im just doing aesthetic modifications for each client.

## Instructions
1. Fork the repo
3. Change the name of the folder to something recognizable.
2. Make the custom modifications
3. Configure the .env file, you MUST change the exposed port.
4. Run the compose file using: `docker-compose up -d`

## Modifications map

- static: Custom logos for each app.

## **Issues**
- Need to configure the SaaS network:
- No default user configured: âœ…
- No snapshot configured:
- Add a logo to the login page
